# Spec: Context Size Limits

| | |
|---|---|
| Framework | 1.6.0 |
| Component | spec `context/size-limits` |
| Version | 1.6.0 |
| Parent feature | `feature:context` |
| Supersedes | nothing |
| Status | Released. Loaded on demand. |

Implements plan sections 1.3 and 1.9. This file is the single source of truth for the numbers below.

## 1. Three different measurements

```
source size  ≠  serialized context size  ≠  token cost
```

| Measurement | What it is | Where it is measured |
|---|---|---|
| Source size | bytes of the file in the repository | measured directly against the file |
| Serialized context size | bytes actually supplied to the model for a session: the prompt plus whatever optional items were loaded | worst-case sum of the prompt plus the largest optional items |
| Token cost | what the model's tokenizer charges | **estimated** as `bytes / 4`. The real figure depends on the tokenizer and must be measured with it |

Source bytes are the enforced metric because they are deterministic and checkable in CI. Token figures are an estimate and are labeled as one everywhere.

## 2. Limits

Each tier has its own independent limit, because the tiers have different jobs:

```
limit: prompt_bytes = 20000
limit: feature_bytes = 7000
limit: spec_section_bytes = 9000
limit: max_optional_bytes = 14000
```

| Limit | Applies to | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt_bytes` | the mandatory prompt file, always loaded | one fixed maximum |
| `feature_bytes` | each file in `feature/` | per loaded feature |
| `spec_section_bytes` | each file in `specs/*/` | per requested section; larger than a feature because specs hold detail |
| `max_optional_bytes` | the largest feature plus the largest spec section | the most optional context normally loaded at once (one feature and one spec section). The linter checks that this worst case fits |

Derived targets, expressed in the estimate unit:

- **Total instruction context** (prompt plus the optional maximum): 34,000 bytes, about 8,500 tokens estimated. Normal sessions are prompt only.
- **Contextual Memory**: keep it to roughly 2,000 tokens of validated state. This is a runtime target. It cannot be checked statically, and compaction (see the context feature) is how you stay under it.

A change that needs to exceed a limit must change the number here, in the same commit, with the reason. That is the point of a bound.

## 3. What the limits are for

The framework grew a ledger, extraction, modes and memory rules for 1.6.0. Without tiers, all of that would be part of the mandatory prompt. With tiers, it loads on demand. At the time this was introduced:

| | Bytes | Est. tokens |
|---|---|---|
| 1.5.0 mandatory prompt | 18,003 | ~4,500 |
| 1.6.0 mandatory prompt | 19,001 | ~4,750 |
| Worst case with optional context (largest feature + largest spec) | ~31,000 | ~7,800 |
| Everything loaded at once, which the rules forbid | ~55,000 | ~13,700 |

The mandatory prompt did **not** shrink: it grew about 5.5%, because the tier machinery (index, escalation rules, session state) costs more than the situational text moved out saved. The gain is that roughly 30 KB of capability stays out of it.

## 4. Failure behavior

A limit violation fails the lint. The remedy is to move detail down a tier or shorten it. Raising a limit needs a stated reason (section 2).
